# Security

## Boundary

`provenact-agent-kit` is a thin adapter over `provenact-sdk`.
Trust-critical verification and execution controls are delegated to `provenact-sdk`
and `provenact-cli`.

## Non-goals

- no direct key management
- no policy bypass
- no autonomous decision engine

## Reporting

Report vulnerabilities privately to maintainers before public disclosure.
